    <h2>Introduction To Programming language:</h2>
    <p>"I am currently enrolled in the 'Introduction to Programming Languages' course at <b>Saylani</b>, where I am
        learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is done using only HTML, as we have completed the HTML section
        of the
        course.As part of the 'Introduction to Programming Languages' course at Saylani, I have been building a strong
        foundation in web development by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We started with HTML, the backbone of web
        page structure, which has allowed me to create the fundamental layout and content of web pages. This project
        showcases my understanding of HTML, where I applied various elements, tags, and attributes to create a fully
        structured page.With HTML now completed, I am excited to move on to CSS and JavaScript, where I will learn how
        to style and add
        interactivity to my web pages. This foundational knowledge will enable me to create dynamic, responsive websites
        and applications. I look forward to integrating all these technologies as I progress through the course."
